## About 
You are to design, build, deploy, and present an application built for a real world customer.

There are forty rooms over two floors available for use by anyone for professional work. The booking of these rooms is currently managed using a basic spreadsheet system. 
This is a  web-based application that allows the client  to login from anywhere to easily, accurately and quickly make a bookings.

This will help to ensure that room resources are used as fully-utilised as possible, whilst avoiding double-bookings and other common user frustrations. It will also make room booking statistics available to the client's staff and management to assist their planning and decision-making.
